這幾首兒歌我兒子特別喜歡，其中幾首我也做了改編，在此紀錄。

* [Old MacDonald Had A Farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxBdN_8ltR8)

```js
Old macdonald had a farm
yi a yi a o

and on the farm he had a cat
yi a yi a o

with a miaomiao here
and miaomiao there

here miao there miao
everywhere miaomiao

Old macdonald had a farm
yi a yi a o


//==以下改編==
Old macdonald had a farm
yi a yi a o

and on the farm he had a "baby"
yi a yi a o

with a "wawa" here
and "wawa" there

here "wa" there "wa"
everywhere "wawa"

Old macdonald had a farm
yi a yi a o

```

* [Five Little Ducks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NUiGQpQFAM)

```js
Five little ducks went out one day 
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
But only four little ducks came back

//==以下改編==
One little "baby" went out one day 
Over the hills and far away
Mother "美香" said, "baby 快回來"
"你的奶粉已經泡好了"

```

* [I Love the Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCPg3Bx1vf0)

```js
I love the mountains 
I love the rolling hills 
I love the flowers
I love the daffodils(水仙)
I love the fireside(暖爐)
When all the lights are low 
(當夜幕降臨)

Boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-yay
Boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee-yay
```
